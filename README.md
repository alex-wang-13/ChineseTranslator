# ChineseTranslator

Description & I/O:

A web page to test your understanding of the Chinese langauge.

Users can enter Chinese text and their English translations as key-value pairs, store them in a dictionary, and use the dictionary to translate Chinese text entered by the user. The page has the following main components:

1.    A textbox for user input where users can enter Chinese text for translation.
2.    A button to translate the words in the text box with user-provided definitions.
3.    A form to enter Chinese text and its English translations as key-value pairs.
4.    A button to reset the current dictionary.
5.    A button to show the current dictionary.

When the user enters Chinese text for translation, a script matches each Chinese character in the text with its corresponding user-provided translation in the dictionary and replaces the Chinese character with the translation in square brackets.

The script validates incoming dictionary entries to ensure that the key contains only Chinese characters and the value contains only non-Chinese characters.

Presentation:
What - A webpage to test a user's Chinese comprehension.
Why  - To help a user exapnd their knowledge of Chinese.
For Whom - For me, and for any other Chinese language learner.
What Next - Incorporate ChatGPT API to automatically generate Chinese text without the need for user-input. Also could expand to non-Chinese languages.
Will People Care? - As long as there's a desire to learn langauge (even outside of Chinese), this webpage can be useful.

Design/Idea:
- I think the simple design makes the webpage very easy to use. The buttons are well-labeled, and directions are clear.
- The cleverness is that there is the user (or in the future, AI) will provide the sentences to translate. This gives more flexibility to the user in terms of what content they want to learn. This webpage/tool is very user-driven.
- The execution I think is good; while there could be more features added in the future, there are no clear bugs at the moment.
- Potential to make money: Could be a powerful AI tool to help people learn languages, especially after incorporating ChatGPT, or alternatively adding a database of default Chinese sentences.
